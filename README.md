## 🚀 Project Overview

1.  **Clone this project.**

    Colne this git project into your local machine.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    git clone https://github.com/ar-pavel/Static-Portfolio.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd ${directory_name} #default 'Static-Portfolio'
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `${directory_name}` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── src
    ├    ├── components
    ├    ├── images
    ├    └── pages
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby.* #generatedfiles
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser) such as the site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”. This directory contains three more directories.

2.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

3.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of the code consistent.

4.  **`gatsby.*` _generatedfiles_**: All the files starts with `gatsby` are generated by gatsby. They store gatsby [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/), [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any), [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) , [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/), and so on.

5.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with the own license.

6.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of the npm dependencies that were installed for the project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for the project.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about the project.
